Known Bugs:
 - Resetting the board causes the right-click flag functionality to be disabled.

Things that do not work upon submission of project:
 - There is no bombs remaining counter
 - The reset button does not change to the death symbol when clicking on a bomb

Things that are currently working upon submission of project:
 - The reset button successfully resets the board
 - Right clicking a tile will flag it (asides from the bug mentioned previously)
 - Revealing empty tiles will reveal all adjacent number tiles, and revealing a number tile will reveal all adjacent empty tiles and any empty tiles adjacent to them (this chaining of empty tiles will also reveal adjacent number tiles to the empty ones)
 - The board is randomly generated, with 10 random bombs in each game instance
